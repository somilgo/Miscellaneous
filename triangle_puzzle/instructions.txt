1. Start with an equilateral triangle and a point chosen at random from the interior of that triangle.  Label one vertex 1, 2, a second vertex 3, 4, and the last vertex 5, 6. Roll a die to pick a vertex. Place a dot at the point halfway between the roll-selected vertex and the point you chose. Now consider this new dot as a starting point to do this experiment once again. Roll the die to pick a new vertex. Place a dot at the point halfway between the last point and the most recent roll-selected vertex. Continue this procedure. What does the shape of the collection of dots look like? Consider writing some software to determine what happens.
